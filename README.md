The Law Chatbot is a retrieval-based assistant that helps users quickly find relevant information from Indian legal documents. It reads uploaded judgments and Acts, breaks them into overlapping chunks, and converts them into vector embeddings for semantic search. When a question is asked, the system pulls the closest matching passages and generates a short answer that relies only on the retrieved text. This retrieval-first design prevents unsupported claims and keeps every response traceable through file and page citations. A simple Streamlit interface presents the answer and source excerpts, making verification easy and transparent.
